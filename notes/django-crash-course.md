# React Context

introduced with v16 - it's revamped

## What is it?

Props System in react allows you to get data from a parent component to a DIRECT child component
e.g APP = buttonText => Header = buttonText => Button

Context System allows you to get data from a parent component to ANY nested child component
e.g APP = buttonText => Header => Button (receives buttonText from App)

It's all about communicating within components

Communicating in props component

Context is just about communication

## Purpose
